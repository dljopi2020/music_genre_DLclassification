# music_genre_DLclassification
 In this repository music genre classification systems (i.e., CNN; RNN) are implemented to classify music genres based on audio fragments of songs in a WAV format. The fragments are based on whole songs found in the GTZAN dataset. Additionally, we augment our data-set by dividing the fragments in subsets in order to improve the training step in our models.
